# Cyberpunk 2077 tweaks

This game does not let you rebind certain keys (such as 'F') by default. WTF.
So this repo includes some remappings so I can use ESDF instead of WASD for
movement.

To use, place `inputUserMappings.xml` in e.g.
`Steam/steamapps/common/Cyberpunk 2077/r6/config`, overwriting the file there.
